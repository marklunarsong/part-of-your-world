# part-of-your-world
I wanna be where the people are ♫
I wanna see, wanna see 'em dancin' ♫
Walking around on those, what do you call 'em? ♫
Oh, feet ♫
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far ♫
Legs are required for jumping, dancing ♫
Strolling along down the, what's that word again? ♫
Streeeet ♫
